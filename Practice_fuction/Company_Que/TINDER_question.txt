Tinder Coding assesment:


QUESTION 1: You are given two arrays A, B and a list of queries - q. There are two types of queries - type 1: (1,i,x) where you set B[i] = x and type 2: (0, x) where you must calculate all pairs in A, B such that a[i] + b[j] == x. You must return a list of length equal to the number of type 2 queries. Keep in mind that after a type 1 query your B is now different.

example: A = [1,2], B = [3,4,5]. If the first query is (0, 5) you want to append the number 2 to your answer array because 1 + 4 = 5 and 2 + 3 = 5. (This is just the first query and there may be many more)


QUESTION 2:Given an N x N matrix, find a k x k submatrix where k <= N and k >= 1, such that sum of all the elements in submatrix is maximum. The input matrix can contain zero, positive and negative numbers.
For example consider below matrix, if k = 3, then output should print the sub-matrix enclosed in blue.
